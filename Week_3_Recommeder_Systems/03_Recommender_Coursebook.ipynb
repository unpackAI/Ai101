The reason this method is called content-based is because we need to understand the \"content\" of the item or user through the features.\n",
        "2. **Collaborative filtering:** Collaborative filtering methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations. Oppositely to the first approach, the actual content and features are unimportant.\n",

Instead of defining features accross users or features, we simply look at what movies the current user has watched or rated well, find other users that have watched or liked the same movies, and then recommend new movies the other users have watched or liked to the current user. Because it is solely based on the past interactions recorded between users and items (i.e. movies) in order to produce new recommendations, we essentially construct a network of all users and movies and can cluster and correctly assume the user's preferences based on their similarity to other users.\n",

In other words, to use this approach we don't necessarily need to know anything about the movies, except who like to watch them.\n",

Netflix may not know these particular properties of the films you have watched, but it will be able to see that other people that have watched the same movies that you watched also tended to watch other movies that are science fiction, full of action, and were made in the 1970s. In other words, our model does not need to necessarily need to know anything about the movies, except who like to watch them.\n",

But you never actually told Netflix that you like these kinds of movies. And Netflix never actually needed to add columns to its movies table saying which movies are of these types. Still, there must be some underlying pattern why a person prefers one set of movies over another. It is the models job, to identify and find this assumed pattern that allows it to make good predictions.\n",
