# DL101: Apply AI in Any industry.  

It's a 4 week learning program to get a practical overview of AI & Machine Learning & build a skillset and confidence to start off AI Lighthouse Projects & AI Innovation. The program contains flexible yet powerful ML pipelines in

👁computer vision

📊tabular

🎯recommender systems

🎤natural language processing (NLP)

### Each week revolves around an intuitive ML workflow that sets up the framework for ML systems development:

1️⃣ Undestanding the business problem and translating it into ML Task (e.g image recognition, text classificaion, regression etc)

2️⃣ Collecting or loading dataset, understanding data, exploratory data analysis

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing and Data Transformations

4️⃣ ML model training and evaluation

5️⃣ Model Predictions and Deployment

### The tools and Python libaries:

1. [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) for image recognition and collaborative filtering
2. unpackai for data handling and code simplification
3. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data loading and underpinning a data manipulation of any structured data
4. [Pandas Profiling](https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/index.html) and [AutoViz](https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz) for automatic exploratory data analyis
5. [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) for tabular data preprocessing and model traininig using AutoML approach
6. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for NLP Problems
